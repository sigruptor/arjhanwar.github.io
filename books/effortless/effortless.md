**Part1 - Effortless State**<br/>
An experience we have when we are physically rested, emotionally unburndened and mentally energized. Completely aware, present, alert and focussed on whats
important this moment. 

**Chapter 1: Invert: What If This Could Be Easy**<br/>
There is this common misconception that all important things are supposed to be hard. Look at the problem from the other angle. Instead of thinking about 
why a particular problem is so hard, invert the question by asking what if this could be easy. Challenge the assumption that the right way is the hard way.
Find an indirect approach, if something becomes overwhelming check and see if you are making it harder than it is.

**Chapter 2: ENJOY: What If This Could Be Fun**<br/>
Pair most essential activities with the most fun ones. Accept that work and play can coexist. Turn tedious task into meaningful rituals. Allow fun to
lighten up your moments. One example - kids not wanting to do dishes, they started having it as a small competition with scoreboard and music and the result
was that everyone got super involved in the activity.

**Chapter 3: RELEASE: The Power Of Letting Go**<br/>
Let go of emotional burden you dont need to keep carrying. When you focus on what you lack, you lose what you have; And when you focus on what you have, you
get what you lack. Follow this recipe, each time I complain, I will say something I am thankful for. Think what what job have I hired this grudge to do ?

**Chapter 4: REST: The Art of Doing Nothing**<br/>
Discover the art of doing nothing. Dont do more today than you can completely recover by tomorrow. You cant catch up on fatigue and sleep. For most efficient
results, never compromise on sleep and rest. Break down important work into 90 sessions each. Try to add an effortless nap in your routing.

**Chapter 5: NOTICE: How To See Clearly**<br/>
Achieve the state of heightened awareness by harnessing the power of presence. Train your brain to focus on important and ignore irrelevant. Pick you battles
wisely and one important lesson - "Remember the good forget the worse". This keeps your brain less cluttered and more focussed. Clear the clutter in your
physical environment as it helps to clear the clutter in your brain..Remove the clutter from your desk.

 we could save more time by fixing a particular thing which takes a slightly more time today than to spend those
 extra minutes everyday.

**Part II: Effortless Action**<br/>
This means to achieve more by trying less. Stop procrastinating and take the first few steps. Zero always seem intimidating (Coders starting with
new files could be daunting), but once there is some progress, you get the momentum. You arrive at the point of completion without overdoing it. You
make progress by pacing yourself than powering through. Overachive without overexerting.
