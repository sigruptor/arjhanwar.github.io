# Sorting Algorithms

### Insertion Sort
- Loop Invariant arr[1..i] is always sorted.
- Inserting an element into its correct position wrt 1..i such that arr[1..i] is always sorted.
```
for (int i=i;i<n;i++) {
	int k=i-1;
	int key=a[k];
	while (k>=0 && a[k]>a[k+1]) {
		swap(a,k+1, k);
		k--;
	}
	a[k+1]=key;
}
```

##### Complexity
**TimeComplexity** -> O(n^2). Used when data is nearly sorted or when data size is small.

##### Properties
- Stable
- O(1) extra space
- O(n^2) comparisons and swaps
- O(n) when nearly sorted
- Adaptive

### Quick Sort
- Divide and conquer algorithm
- Relies on partition algorithm which picks a pivot and puts it into its corresponding position. Quicksort then sorts left and right side of the paritions recurisively.

```
quickSort(a,start,end) {
   int pivot = partition(a,start,end);
   quickSort(a,start, pivot-1)
   quickSort(a, pivot+1, end);
}

partition(a, start, end) {
   int pivot=a[end-1]; // choosing the last element
   int low=start-1;
   for (int j=start;j<end-1;j++) {
   	if (a[j]<pivot) {
	   low++;
	   swap(a,low,j);
	}
   }
   low++;
   swap(a,low,end-1); // puts the pivot into its right position
   return low;
}
```

##### Complexity
**TimeComplexity** 
- Best Case: When partition is balanced i.e (n/2, n/2(n/2-1) O(nlogn)
- Worst Case: parition is totally unbalanced (1, n-1) -> O(n^2)

**Space Complexity**
- Worst Case: O(n) -> when partition is unbalanced happens when input is sorted.
- Average Case: O(logn)

##### Properties
- Not Stable
- In Place
- Not Adaptive

### Merge Sort
- Classic divide and conquer problem, split array into 2 recursively, merge them.
- Very predictable and only stable O(nlogn) algorithm.
- Takes between .5log(n) and log(n) comparisons and between log(n) and 1.5 log(n) swaps per element. 
- Minima for already sorted data and maxima for random data.
- If O(n) extra space is not a concern, this is an excellent choice and used mostly for external sort

```
mergeSort(a[], start, end) {
   if (end > start) {
     int mid = (start+end)/2;
     mergeSort(a, start, mid-1);
     mergeSort(a, mid, end);
     merge(a, start, mid, end);
   }
}

merge(a,start,mid,end) {
  int temp[end-start+1];
  i=start;j=mid+1;
  k=0;
  
  while(i<=mid && j<=end) {
  	if (a[i]<a[j]) {
		temp[k++]=a[i++]  
	} else {
		temp[k++]=a[j++]
	}
  }
  
  // copy remaining i.ss
  while(i<=mid) {
  	temp[k++]=a[i++];
  }
  // copy remaining j.ss
  while(j<=end) {
  	temp[k++]=a[j++];
  }
  
  //copy temp to a
  for (int i=0;i<end-start+1;i++) {
  	a[i]=temp[i];
  }
}
```

##### Complexity
**TimeComplexity**
- O(nlog(n)) -> min for already sorted data

**Space Complexity**
- O(n) - extra space
- Extra O(log(n)) - for linked list (recursions)

##### Useful
- Stability is needed
- Sorting of linked lists
- And when random access is much more expensive than sequential access (external sorting on tape)
- There do exist linear time in-place merge algorithms for the last step of the algorithm, but they are both expensive and complex. The complexity is justified for applications such as external sorting when Î˜(n) extra space is not available.

##### Properties
- Stable
- O(n) extra space for arrays
- Requires O(logn) extra space for linked list (recursion)
- Not adaptive
- Does not require random access to data
