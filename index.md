### Mission
Changing the world is what everyone dreams of, I am no different. The question "**how**" has always troubled me, still figuring that out. Though what i have realized is that you dont have to wait for that magical thing which would improve millions of lives, just start small. Start with improving (try) one life, for every life counts and at least you will be [making a difference to one (it matters)](https://www.catalystscrubs.com/blogs/news/70248323-make-a-difference-monday-the-starfish-story). 
This would be my effort to contribute back to the community, hoping to share my learnings from different stories, books, jobs, life. Would also love to share my work, hoping to develop interesting tools.<br/>
